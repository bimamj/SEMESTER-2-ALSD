### 5.2.5 Questions Answer
1. The function of the block of code is to check and compare the value of each index and swap it with each other if the condition is met. The swap is possible because firstly the new value is stored in `temp` after that the old value is swapped.
2. This block of code implements the minimum values search algorithm ![Screenshot](img/image4.png)
3. The condition means, `j` is bigger than 0, to prevent the first index to be checked again, and `data[j] > key` is to make sure that `j` is bigger than `key` which checked the left index is bigger than the right
4. It is to change or 'swap' the value of right and left indes that is being compared.
