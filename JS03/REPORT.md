# 1.2 Experiment 1 Create, insert, and display Array of Object

### 1.2.2 Result

### 1.2.3 Questions Answer
1. A class doesn't necesserily need to have attribute and methods, but in this case it will throw an error if we delete the ```Rectangle()``` attributes, because it no longer has length and width, there for we cannot assign the designated value of it's length and width
2. No, but in Java if a class doesn't define a constructor, the java compiler will automaticaly provides a default constructor without any parameter. So we can just instatntiate the object
3. It declares, instantiate, and initialize an array of ```Rectangle``` reference with the size of 3
4. - The first line instantiate a new ```Rectangle``` object in the array index 1
    - The second line assign the ```Rectangle``` in index 1 with the length attribute of 80
    - The third line assign the ```Rectangle``` in index 1 with the width attribute of 80
5. So that we can avoid mixing data representation and logi, we can also reuse the ```Rectangle()``` class in other part of our program if we separate it with ```Array OfObjects``` class.
